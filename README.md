# Customer-relationship-management-API
The objective is to create a HTTP API to manage customer data for a small shop.

First of all I need a Spring Boot project, dependencies.
- Spring web for a webapplication.
- H2 for in-memory database
- Lombok for reducing boilerplate code

- Web-application structure created: controller, dao, dto, service packages
- db connection properties in application.properties
- import.sql will be executed automatically on every startup for db test
